## üîß Technical Demonstration Points

### **Code Sections to Highlight**

#### **1. Main.java - Application Structure**
```java
// Show CardLayout navigation
public void showCard(String cardName) {
    cardLayout.show(contentPanel, cardName);
}

// Demonstrate color constants
public static final Color PRIMARY_BLUE = new Color(52, 73, 94);
```

#### **2. Event.java - Encapsulation**
```java
// Show private fields and public methods
private String title;
public String getTitle() { return title; }
```

#### **3. PaymentPanel.java - Validation**
```java
// Show regex validation
Pattern cardPattern = Pattern.compile("^\\d{16}$");
return cardPattern.matcher(cardNumber).matches();
```

#### **4. SwingWorker Threading**
```java
// Show background processing
SwingWorker<Void, Void> worker = new SwingWorker<Void, Void>() {
    protected Void doInBackground() {
        Thread.sleep(4000);
        return null;
    }
};

## üéØ Q&A Preparation

### **Expected Questions & Answers**

**Q: "Why did you choose Java Swing over other GUI frameworks?"**
A: "Swing is part of the core Java curriculum and provides excellent learning opportunities for OOP concepts. It's also platform-independent and suitable for academic projects."

**Q: "How does your application handle data storage?"**
A: "The application uses ArrayList for in-memory storage, which is appropriate for academic projects. In production, this would be replaced with database integration."

**Q: "Can you explain the payment processing simulation?"**
A: "The payment uses SwingWorker for background processing, simulating real-world payment gateway interaction with proper threading to maintain UI responsiveness."

**Q: "What OOP principles does your code demonstrate?"**
A: "Encapsulation through private fields and public methods, inheritance by extending Swing components, polymorphism through interface implementations, and abstraction through MVC separation."
